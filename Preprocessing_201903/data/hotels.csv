Our 4th floor room was an attic with a vaulted ceiling that angles down to 3ft. The bed is only accessible from one side. If you placed your head in the skylight on the other side you might able sit up. The bathtub was impractical with broken shower head. We moved to the 1st floor the next day and within minutes found a centipede on the wall and15 flies. We asked for a broom to get rid of the centipede. Later in the day the receptionist said she gave us something to control the bugs. We never complained about the drain flies so she must have noticed a problem. That night we spent 2 hrs catching 6 centipedes in our room. 2 came from throw pillows. We asked reception for a new room or hotel but there supposedly weren't any hotels with open rooms and if we wanted leave we would have to pay for transportation and both hotels. The next morning we went to reception to tell them about the bug problem. We barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didn't put the bugs in the room on purpose so we should just go about our day and forget it. She added that she often goes on vacation with her children and sometimes things happen, so she tries to make the best of everything and not start a war. Adding, a few euros isn't going to make anything go away so we should just go enjoy the day because more we talk the less time we have.","Dungeons, Drain Flies and Centipedes",,A Traveler,

The dcor of the room was pleasant and flawless, unlike many of the Venice hotels I've stayed in. The breakfast buffet was delicious too. And to finish all this off, the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. In terms of location, the hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido waterbus stop, then a boat takes around 15 mins to get into Venice. We didn't find this a problem at all - we knew this was going to be the case so had pre-booked transport tickets to save money. The surrounding Lido is pleasant and worth an explore in a spare couple of hours. In conclusion, I would book this again due to the fantastic quality of the hotel, despite the trade-off of not being in Venice itself.",Excellent hotel with good access to Venice,,Simon,

Der Aufenthalt war durchweg angenehm. Das Frhstcksbuffet war reichhaltig und frisch (allerdings rate ich von dem Rhrei ab). Wenn etwas aufgebraucht war, wurde es umgehend aufgefllt. Vom Frhstcksraum aus konnte man den Blick ber die Lagune genieen. Obwohl unser Zimmer im Erdgeschoss zur Nebenstrae hin lag, war es dort sehr ruhig. Die Einrichtung ist geschmackvoll und zweckmig. An Sauberkeit mangelte es nicht. Obwohl wir nicht den Anspruch stellten, wurden die Handtcher tglich gewechselt. Das einzige Manko war die Temperatur des Duschwassers. Es wechselte stndig von ziemlich kalt zu sehr hei. Erwhnenswert ist auch das Waschbecken. Der Wasserhahn ist ziemlich klein und so ber dem hervorstehenden berlauf angebracht, dass es schon schwierig ist, die Hnde darunter zu waschen. Der Empfang an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich. Leider war unser Koffer nicht mit uns angekommen. Die nette Empfangsdame kmmerte sich darum und hielt Kontakt mit dem Flughafen.

I requested flowers for the room as it was one of my wife's special birthday's, and yes they ordered exactly as requested, can't ask for more. Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasn't a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere.

The hotel is on the Lido, which is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from Venice. However, if you're looking for a place on the Lido, this is a well-priced option. The staff was great with handling/recommending dinner reservations, even during an insane Carnevale weekend. The doors are a little thin and since the building is old, the soundproofing needs improvement. The quarters are cramped, but the room comes with breakfast. If we wanted to stay on the Lido again, this would be a good option, but next time I think we'll opt for a place closer to the action. Recommended.","Good option, great staff, quiet neighborhood",,Matthew,

When I mentioned the unattractiveness to the desk clerk she acknowledged the problem and very nicely explained that the place was due for a major overhaul.
